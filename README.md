Part 1: Write a program that accepts the number of people attending your party, the budget for your party, the price per slice of pizza, and the price per pie of pizza. Your program should then identify how many slices each person wants and determine how many individual slices and pies to order without exceeding your budget. If you exceed your budget, the program should warn the user they can't place their order. Note that for the purpose of this program a pizza pie contains 8 slices. And note that the restaurant you are ordering from will not sell you more than 7 individual slices at a time (if you need to purchase 8 slices you will have to buy a whole pie).

You do not need to validate the first four input statements (total budget, cost per slice, cost per pie and # of people attending party). You will have to validate the user's input when prompting them for the number of slices for each person coming to the party (i.e. Enter number of slices for person #1).

Part 2: Write a gradebook program that lets a teacher keep track of test averages for his or her students. Your program shoudl begin by asking the teacher for a number of students in their class as well as the total # of tests that will be given to the class. Validate this information to ensure that the numbers entered are positive.

Next, prompt the teacher to enter in scores for each student. Ensure that the values entered are positive - if they aren't you will need to re-prompt them.Once your program has collected all test scores for a student it should display that student's average and move onto the next student. When all students have been calculated the program should compute the overall average score for the entire class.

Part 3a: Write a program that prompts the user to enter in a postiive number. Only accept positive numbers - if the user supplies a negative number or zero you should re-prompt them.

Next, determine if the given number is a prime number. A prime number is a number that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 5 is prime because the only numbers that evenly divide into 5 are 1 and 5. 6, however, is not prime because 1, 2, 3 and 6 are all divisors of 6.

Part 3b: Next, make a copy of Part A and update it so that the program now finds all prime numbers between 1 and 1000.

Part 3c: Make a copy of Part B and update it so that the user can choose to examin a specific range of numbers for prime numbers.

Part 3d: Print the prime numbers that you find within the given range so that only 10 numbers print per line. Align the numbers so that they stack neatly on top of one another in all cases (i.e. the table should line up no matter what number range you are analyzing).

Part 4: Write a program that allows the user to build either an addition, subtraction, or multiplication table. Your program should contain both 'for' loops and 'while' loops, and it will also contain nested loops. When building your table, it should look as close as possible to the ones below. Your tables must:
Contain column and row headers with line separators
The operator (+, -, *) associated with the table in the top left corner
The ability to choose exactly how many rows and columns you would like present in your table
Appropriate spacing between each character (i.e. you do not want 7 8 9 10111213)
